# Changelog

All notable changes to the Jude Tour Guide project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.1.4] - 2025-09-08

### üß≠ SEO
- Unified canonical URLs to `https://www.tourguidejude.com` and removed manual `<link rel="canonical">` from `src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx` to avoid conflicting canonicals reported by PSI.
- Updated `languageAlternates` to the same canonical domain.

### ‚ö° Performance
- Modernized `browserslist` production targets in `package.json` to reduce legacy JavaScript transforms (addresses PSI "Legacy JavaScript" waste on desktop).
- Set `fetchPriority="high"` for the LCP hero image in `src/components/sections/HeroSectionSimple.tsx` to reinforce LCP stability.

### üì¶ Version
- Bumped package version to `2.1.4`.

## [2.1.3] - 2025-09-08

### ‚ö° Performance Improvements
- Lazy-mounted site-wide visuals using `LazyMount` to reduce initial JS and main-thread work:
  - `AnimatedBackground` is mounted on idle in `src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx`.
  - Footer aquatics (`UnderwaterOceanAnimation`, `WaterRipplesEffect`) are dynamically imported (`next/dynamic`, `ssr: false`) and mounted when near the viewport in `src/components/layout/FooterCompact.tsx`.
- Added `content-visibility: auto` and `contain-intrinsic-size` utilities (`cv-auto`, `cis-800`) in `src/app/globals.css` and applied to below-the-fold sections on the home page (`src/app/[locale]/page.tsx`).

### üñºÔ∏è LCP Image Optimization
- Converted hero image to a static import with `placeholder="blur"` and `sizes` in `src/components/sections/HeroSectionSimple.tsx` for more stable LCP and reduced layout shifts.

### üåê Networking
- Added `<link rel="preconnect"/>` and `dns-prefetch` for `cdnjs.cloudflare.com` (used by `TwemojiIcon`) in `src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx`.

### üì¶ Version
- Bumped package version to `2.1.3`.

## [2.1.2] - 2025-09-08

### ‚öôÔ∏è Runtime Stability Fix
- Removed custom Webpack `optimization.splitChunks` override in `next.config.ts` to prevent `originalFactory is undefined` runtime errors on the Packages page (App Router + Radix Select on Next.js 15.5.2). Reverted to Next.js defaults for reliable module evaluation order.

### üßº Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) Reductions
- Hardened `src/components/optimization/CriticalCSS.tsx` to only defer stylesheets explicitly marked with `data-defer="true"`.
- Added guard to never touch Next.js core CSS at `/_next/static/css/`.
- Small dev-only logging to help verify behavior during development.

### üñãÔ∏è Font Loading Simplification
- Removed external Google Fonts `<link>` tags and the custom `FontOptimizer` usage from `src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx`.
- Now rely solely on `next/font` (`Inter`) for consistent, FOIT/FOUC-free font rendering with a stable fallback face.

### üì¶ Version
- Bumped package version to `2.1.2`.

## [2.1.1] - 2025-09-07

### üöÄ Critical Vercel Deployment Fix

#### ‚ú® Production Deployment Resolution

  "dependencies": {
    "source-map": "^0.7.6"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "source-map": "^0.7.6"
  }
}
```

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Changes
- **next.config.ts**: Added webpack fallback configuration for source-map resolution
- **Package Pages**: Converted from React.use() to useEffect patterns for Next.js 15 compatibility
- **Booking Pages**: Fixed async params handling with proper state management
